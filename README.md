# COSC70-Image-Recognition-Neural-Network

This repository contains all the C++ files from COSC70.01: Foundations of Applied CS. For our final project, we designed a Neural Network that was able to classify handwritten images of single digit numbers with ~84% success rate. 
It also contains files we wrote for smaller assignments earlier in the course. For example, a Matrix class with a bunch of Linear Algebra methods, such as Transform, Transpose, Matrix multiplication, and more.
